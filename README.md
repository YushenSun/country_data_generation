# Country Data Generation

This repository contains a framework for simulating country-level strategic decision-making data, designed for applications in AI modeling, policy prediction, and game-theoretic simulation. It supports bilateral scenario generation with configurable features and actions.

## Features

- Simulates multi-feature country state vectors (economy, military, prestige, etc.)
- Generates action labels such as deployments, sanctions, or diplomatic responses
- Supports dataset creation for classification or sequential prediction tasks
- Easily extendable for reinforcement learning or aspiration-based modeling

## Structure

```
country_data_generation/
├── data_generator.py        # Core logic for state-action pair generation
├── config.py                # Parameters for simulation setup
├── utils.py                 # Helper functions
├── notebooks/
│   └── explore_samples.ipynb   # Example usage and data visualization
└── README.md
```

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YushenSun/country_data_generation.git
cd country_data_generation
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then run the data generator:

```bash
python data_generator.py
```

This will generate a synthetic dataset in `.csv` format with simulated country states and corresponding actions.

## Example Output

Each row corresponds to one decision step and includes:

- `cap_military`, `cap_economy`, `prestige`, ...
- `adversary_posture`, `recent_event`
- `action`: one of `[hardline, negotiate, sanction, deploy, etc.]`

## Applications

- AI policy modeling  
- Strategic simulations  
- Supervised learning or imitation learning tasks  
- Behavioral pattern mining

## Future Work

- Integration with non-maximizing policy models (e.g., aspiration-based agents)  
- Support for multi-agent simulations  
- Export to game engines or interactive environments
